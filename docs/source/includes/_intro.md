From the Recurly [docs site](https://docs.recurly.com/):

"Recurly provides a complete recurring billing system designed to remove all the headaches from subscription billing. Whether youâ€™ve integrated with our Hosted Payment Pages, Recurly.js embedded forms, or API, these documents will help manage your day-to-day billing."

The LFE library for the Recurly REST service was created in order to support the billing needs of LFE, Erlang, and other BEAM language applications that need to offer billing features.
